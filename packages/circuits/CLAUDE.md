# `@zkqes/circuits` — Maintainer Notes

## Purpose

Circom 2 circuits for the zkqes presentation proof (relation `R_zkqes`), plus the
Groth16 ceremony scripts that produce the runtime artifacts shipped to web +
contracts. Phase 1 delivers the **ECDSA-leaf** variant wired against real Diia
QES fixtures; the RSA variant is scaffolded but deferred until non-Diia QES
test material is available.

Proof split (spec §5.4 fallback, forced by the 22 GB compile budget):

- `ZkqesPresentationEcdsaLeaf.circom` — constraints 1, 2, 5, 6 (binding parse,
  pk/timestamp match, message-digest, ctx/decl, leaf ECDSA-P256 verify).
  Outputs `leafSpkiCommit = Poseidon(Poseidon(Xlimbs), Poseidon(Ylimbs))`.
- `ZkqesPresentationEcdsaChain.circom` — constraints 3, 4 (intermediate signs
  leaf TBS, intermediate in Merkle-rTL). Outputs the **same** `leafSpkiCommit`.
  On-chain glue: `ZkqesRegistry` asserts the two commits are equal and that
  `rTL` matches the current flattener root. **Not yet implemented** — Phase 1
  ships leaf-only with the chain constraint enforced off-circuit by the
  trusted-list admin (documented risk in §5.4 of the spec).

## How to run

All commands assume repo root, pnpm 9.x, and Node 20.

```bash
# Full test suite (~15 min — includes the heavy leaf E2E against real QES)
pnpm --filter @zkqes/circuits test

# Type-check (fast)
pnpm --filter @zkqes/circuits lint

# Ceremony scripts (one-shot each, idempotent)
bash packages/circuits/ceremony/scripts/compile.sh
bash packages/circuits/ceremony/scripts/fetch-ptau.sh      # 9.1 GB
bash packages/circuits/ceremony/scripts/setup.sh           # OOMs on <32 GB dev boxes
bash packages/circuits/ceremony/scripts/prove.sh           # witness + prove + verify round-trip
bash packages/circuits/ceremony/scripts/stub-ceremony.sh   # dev-only (for contracts/web wiring)
```

Setup runs locally; the constraint count of the V5 circuit (~1 M planned)
fits comfortably on a dev box. The Phase-1 ECDSA-leaf legacy circuit
(7.6 M constraints, ~30 GB peak) requires a 32+ GB machine to run
`setup.sh` without OOM — bump `MEM_CAP=32G` and `NODE_HEAP=30720`
accordingly when reproducing legacy artifacts.

## Invariants — do not violate

1. **Never commit `.p7s` files.** They carry a real natural person's legal
   identity under QES. Global `.gitignore` covers them; if one ever slips
   through, `git reset --soft` + `git gc --prune=now --aggressive`
   immediately. A pushed `.p7s` requires QES revocation, not just git
   surgery.

2. **Memory cap every circuit compile + test run at 28 GB.** Pattern:
   `systemd-run --user --scope -p MemoryMax=28G -p MemorySwapMax=0
   NODE_OPTIONS='--max-old-space-size=24576' <cmd>`. Without this, the
   machine swaps itself to death before the OOM killer acts — you lose
   unsaved work across the whole desktop, not just the compile.

3. **Test cache is sticky.** `test/helpers/compile.ts` auto-detects a
   prior compile in `build/test-cache/<hash>/` and re-uses its `.wasm` +
   `.r1cs` + `.sym`. That's how repeat test runs are 30 s instead of
   30 min. **Do not set `recompile: true` manually**; modifying the
   circuit source already invalidates via hash.

4. **JCS canonicalization is non-negotiable.** `BindingParseFull` and
   `buildEcdsaWitness` both assume RFC 8785 encoding of the binding JSON.
   If a future fixture disagrees on field ordering or whitespace, the
   SHA-256 inside signedAttrs won't match and the circuit will reject —
   the bug is in the producer, not the circuit.

5. **Two templates must never share include paths with the vendor
   bigint libs.** zk-email and circom-ecdsa-p256 both define
   `CheckCarryToZero`; we disambiguate by removing the dead `fp.circom`
   include from `primitives/vendor/zk-email/lib/sha.circom`. If a new
   vendor drop reintroduces the collision, fix the include — do NOT
   rename the template.

6. **ECDSA-P256 limb encoding is fixed at n=43, k=6 (6×43-bit LE limbs).**
   Any witness helper producing limbs must round-trip through
   `Bytes32ToLimbs643`. secp256k1 pk-match uses a different encoding:
   4×64-bit LE. These are independent — don't reuse helpers.

7. **Constraint count budget: 8 M hard cap, split at ~7 M.** The ECDSA
   leaf is already at 7.63 M. Any new constraints require either removing
   unused sub-circuits or splitting another proof (chain-style). A new
   sub-circuit that pushes past 8 M will OOM even on 40 GB machines
   for the setup phase.

8. **Snarkjs orders `public.json` as `[outputs…, public_inputs…]`**, not
   by declaration order. The Solidity verifier's `input[N]` array matches
   this (with the leading `1` from the witness stripped). If your on-chain
   verifier expects a specific public-signal index layout — and contracts-
   eng's split-proof `ZkqesVerifier.verify` does (orchestration §2.1/§2.2
   pin `leafSpkiCommit` at `leafArr[12]` and `chainArr[2]`, both LAST) —
   make ALL public signals `signal input` and add an internal equality
   constraint (`computedValue === publicInputSignal`) for any value that
   would otherwise be a `signal output`. This applies to
   `ZkqesPresentationEcdsa{Leaf,Chain}.circom`: `leafSpkiCommit` is a
   `signal input` declared LAST in the `component main public [...]`
   list, constrained to equal
   `Poseidon2(Poseidon6(leafXLimbs), Poseidon6(leafYLimbs))`. Caught
   pre-ceremony during the 2026-04-18 split-proof pivot; would have
   produced a silent byte-misalignment between the ceremony stubs and
   contracts-eng's K1 layout.

## Ceremony artifact flow

```
compile.sh      → build/zkqes-presentation/ZkqesPresentationEcdsaLeaf.{r1cs,wasm,sym}
setup.sh        → build/zkqes-presentation/{zkqes.zkey, verification_key.json,
                                            ZkqesGroth16Verifier.sol, zkey.sha256}
prove.sh        → build/zkqes-presentation/{proof.json, public.json}
                  (round-trip test against real Diia fixture)
upload to R2    → ceremony/urls.json  (committed — URLs + sha256 + metadata)

ceremony/ZkqesGroth16Verifier.sol   → committed (11 KB, drop-in for the stub)
ceremony/verification_key.json    → committed (4.9 KB, public)
ceremony/zkey.sha256              → committed (integrity reference)
zkqes.zkey (4.2 GB)               → R2 at prove.identityescrow.org/zkqes.zkey
.wasm    (41 MB)                  → R2 at prove.identityescrow.org/ZkqesPresentationEcdsaLeaf.wasm
```

Consumers (web + contracts) read `ceremony/urls.json` at build time. The
zkey is deliberately NOT committed (git will reject >100 MB objects and GH
rejects >2 GB repos outright); R2's 10 GB free tier + 0 egress fees covers
it with headroom for a Phase-2 re-ceremony.

## Stub vs real verifier

- `circuits/ZkqesPresentationEcdsaLeafStub.circom` — trivial 1-constraint
  circuit with identical public-signal layout (11 inputs + 1 output). Used
  by `stub-ceremony.sh` to produce a dev verifier that forge-compiles and
  contracts can integrate against while the real ceremony runs elsewhere.
- `ceremony/ZkqesGroth16VerifierStub.sol` — NOT committed; build artifact
  only. Real `ceremony/ZkqesGroth16Verifier.sol` IS committed (11 KB).
- At deploy: contracts import `ZkqesGroth16Verifier.sol`. Swap between stub
  and real happens via this path — both contracts have identical
  `verifyProof(uint[2], uint[2][2], uint[2], uint[12]) → bool` ABI.

## Fixtures

- `fixtures/integration/admin-ecdsa/` — real Diia admin binding: full .p7s
  is gitignored (privacy), but the unsigned JSON, signed-attrs DER, leaf
  cert DER, and Merkle path ARE committed because they encode no private
  material beyond what the public admin certificate already publishes.
- `fixtures/x509-samples/` — synthetic RSA + ECDSA SPKI DER for unit tests.
- `fixtures/jcs/` — RFC 8785 vectors (committed, versioned with circuit).

Regenerating a committed fixture is a breaking change — bump a version
comment in the fixture file and update every downstream test in the same
commit, or test suites in other packages will silently drift off it.

## When a test run feels slow

1. Check `build/test-cache/` exists and isn't larger than 30 GB (it caches
   every compile permutation). Stale entries can be deleted; `.mocharc`
   will recompile on hash miss.
2. `mocha --no-config path/to/foo.test.ts` to isolate one file (the
   project `.mocharc.cjs` adds `spec:` which otherwise glob-matches all).
3. A single ECDSA E2E test takes 4–5 min just for witness calculation —
   that's the cost of 1× ECDSA-P256 + 3× SHA256Var + JCS parser in R1CS.
   Not fixable without restructuring the circuit.

## What this package does NOT own

- On-chain verifier deployment → `packages/contracts`.
- Witness construction from a user's fresh QES → `packages/web` builds
  witness inputs client-side using snarkjs + this package's public
  URL artifacts.
- LOTL Merkle root updates → `packages/lotl-flattener`.
- QES attestation service (Phase 2) → `packages/qie-*`.

## V5 architecture (current)

V5 collapses the V4 leaf+chain split into a **single ~3.88M-constraint
circuit** (`circuits/ZkqesPresentationV5.circom`) that takes the QES
verification on-chain via EIP-7212 P256Verify. **V5.1 amends V5 in-place
on the same .circom file (wallet-bound nullifier); V5.2 amends in-place
again (keccak-on-chain).** Empirical envelope is now ~3.876M constraints
with a **22-signal** public-input layout (V5 base shipped 14; V5.1 added
5 → 19; V5.2 dropped 1 + added 4 → 22 — see §V5.11 + §V5.18 below).
The layout is FROZEN per V5 spec §0.1 + V5.1 orchestration §1.1 + V5.2
keccak-on-chain spec §"Public-signal layout V5.1 → V5.2" — adding /
reordering fields is a cross-worker breaking change.

The V4 invariants above (`.p7s` hygiene, test cache stickiness,
fixture provenance, etc.) remain in force. V5 adds the items below;
where V5 numbers replace V4 numbers (memory cap, constraint envelope),
prefer V5.

### V5.1 — Memory caps for compile / ceremony / heavy tests

V4 used `MemoryMax=28G`. **V5 uses 48G.** Empirical peaks:

| Operation | Peak RSS | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `circom --r1cs --wasm` (cold compile) | ~14 GB | 4.02M-constraint R1CS construction in Rust binary |
| `circom_tester.wasm()` (mocha cold compile) | ~32 GB | circom output + V8 holds the witness-calc graph in heap |
| `snarkjs groth16 setup` (zkey new) | ~30 GB | 9.1 GB pot23 + R1CS matrices + G1/G2 scratch tables |
| `snarkjs.groth16.fullProve` (mocha runtime) | ~26 GB | 2.2 GB zkey + V8 BigInt MSM scratch |

V4's 28 GB cap was tight for V4-leaf (which compiled at ~6.5M
constraints in ~22 GB) and **does not fit V5** — `circom_tester.wasm()`
OOMs reproducibly at 28 GB. New pattern:

```bash
systemd-run --user --scope -p MemoryMax=48G -p MemorySwapMax=0 \
  NODE_OPTIONS='--max-old-space-size=46080' \
  <cmd>
```

For `circom` CLI direct (not `circom_tester.wasm()`), the cap can drop
to 24G — the binary doesn't double-buffer the witness-calc graph.

### V5.2 — `--exit` flag in mocha test scripts

`snarkjs.groth16.fullProve` leaks Worker threads (open issue against
snarkjs). mocha 4+ waits for the event loop to drain before exiting,
so the runner hangs indefinitely after tests pass — observed an
~85 s test session sit at 20 GB RSS for 8+ hours overnight without
exiting until manually killed.

**Fix: `mocha --exit`** in every script that runs heavy V5 tests.
Already applied to package.json's `test` and `test:v5` scripts.

### V5.3 — Cold-compile pattern (avoid `circom_tester.wasm()` for V5 main)

For ad-hoc constraint-count probes, run circom directly:

```bash
circom circuits/ZkqesPresentationV5.circom --r1cs --wasm \
  -l circuits -l node_modules -o build/zkqes-presentation/
pnpm exec snarkjs r1cs info build/zkqes-presentation/ZkqesPresentationV5.r1cs
```

(`pnpm -F @zkqes/circuits compile:v5` packages the above.)

The mocha test path uses `circom_tester.wasm()` which is convenient
but ~2× memory-heavier; it's fine for warm-cache replay (cheap) but
the FIRST run (cache cold) will OOM under V4's 28 GB cap.

### V5.4 — Constraint envelope

- Empirical V5 base (post-§6.10): **4,020,936 constraints** (snarkjs r1cs info).
- Empirical V5.1 (post-A6.1 wallet-bound nullifier): **4,022,171 constraints** (+1,235 vs V5: T1 +738, T3 +497).
- Cap: **4,500,000** per spec amendment 9c866ad. Headroom ~10.6% (V5.1).
- Wires (V5.1): ~3,956,793. Public inputs: **19** (V5: 14). Private inputs: 10,526 (V5: 9,756).
- V4 hard cap was 8M; V5's tighter envelope reflects ECDSA-on-chain.

**Don't widen the cap without surfacing.** A bigger envelope means
slower prove time + larger zkey, both of which threaten the
mobile-browser acceptance gate (web-eng spec-pass-5).

### V5.5 — `MAX_LEAF_TBS = 1408` (1024 → 1408 empirical bump)

Real Diia leaf TBSCertificate measures **1203 bytes** (admin-ecdsa
fixture). Spec amendment eeb2f4a bumped from the original 1024
(estimated assuming "~700-900 bytes") to 1408 to fit. ~17% headroom
over the 1216 padded-length floor — matches the spec convention
established by MAX_BCANON (real 849, ~21%) and MAX_SA (real 1388,
~10%).

### V5.6 — Vendored Keccak: bkomuves/hash-circuits @ `4ef64777` (MIT)

V5 §6.8 needs in-circuit Keccak-256 for the `msgSender` ←
`keccak256(uncompressed_pk[1:])[12:]` derivation. We vendor
**bkomuves/hash-circuits** at commit `4ef64777cc9b78ba987fbace27e0be7348670296`
(Faulhorn Labs / Balazs Komuves, MIT, last commit 2025-01-24).

| Why bkomuves over alternatives | |
|---|---|
| vocdoni/keccak256-circom | GPL-3.0, 4-year stale, "WIP experimental" |
| rarimo/passport-zk-circuits | MIT but pulls in transitive bitify+sha2 deps + bit-level API |
| **bkomuves/hash-circuits** | **MIT, 4 self-contained files, byte-level `Keccak_256_bytes(input_len)` API** |

PROVENANCE.md in `circuits/primitives/vendor/bkomuves-keccak/`
documents the pin + sha256 of each vendored file. Updates require a
new provenance entry, fresh checksums, and a new ceremony.

### V5.7 — pot23 ptau

Phase 2 ceremony uses `powersOfTau28_hez_final_23.ptau` (cap 8.39M
constraints, ~110% headroom over the 4.5M circuit envelope).

**Empirical file size: 9.1 GB** (Polygon zkEVM mirror at
`https://storage.googleapis.com/zkevm/ptau/powersOfTau28_hez_final_23.ptau`,
sha256 `047f16d75daaccd6fb3f859acc8cc26ad1fb41ef030da070431e95edb126d19d`).
Spec amendment 9c866ad's "~1.2 GB" estimate was wrong — that's
roughly the size of pot21's "lite" form, not pot23's full Hermez
ceremony output. **Cross-check pending** against canonical Hermez
sha256 manifest before §11 real ceremony.

Disk usage: 9.1 GB ptau + ~1 GB R1CS + ~2.2 GB zkey ≈ 13 GB scratch
during ceremony. Goes into `build/zkqes-presentation/` (gitignored).

### V5.8 — `build-witness-v5` public API

Witness construction lives in `src/build-witness-v5.ts` and exports
the stable surface via `src/index.ts`:

```ts
import {
  buildWitnessV5,
  parseP7s,
  type BuildWitnessV5Input,
  type WitnessV5,
} from '@zkqes/circuits';

const cms = parseP7s(p7sBuffer);
const witness = await buildWitnessV5({
  bindingBytes,
  leafCertDer: cms.leafCertDer,
  leafSpki, intSpki,
  signedAttrsDer: cms.signedAttrsDer,
  signedAttrsMdOffset: cms.signedAttrsMdOffset,
});
// `witness` is plain JSON ready for snarkjs.wtns.calculate.
```

CLI: `pnpm -F @zkqes/circuits exec build-witness-v5 ...`. Two modes:
`--p7s <path>` (real Diia ingestion) OR
`--signed-attrs/--md-offset/--leaf-cert` (pre-extracted artifacts).

**Subtle contract**: `signedAttrsMdOffset` is the offset of the
**leading `0x30 0x2f` Attribute SEQUENCE byte** (the start of
`SignedAttrsParser.circom`'s 17-byte EXPECTED_PREFIX walker), NOT
the digest content offset. `parseP7s` byte-checks the leadIn
before returning. Web-eng's vendored copy MUST preserve this
convention or §6.4 breaks silently.

### V5.9 — prove + verify resource envelope (test/integration/v5-prove-verify)

`groth16.fullProve` on the V5 circuit + 2.2 GB zkey: peak RSS
~26 GB, wall ~85 s. **Test gracefully `describe.skip`s** when the
local zkey is missing (typical fresh checkout — `.zkey` is
gitignored). CI runners with <32 GB available memory will OOM if
the zkey IS present; ship the test only if a 48 GB cap is enforced.

The committed sample artifacts (`ceremony/v5_1/proof-sample.json`
+ `public-sample.json`) re-verify against the stub vkey at near-zero
cost — that's the second test in the suite, runs everywhere. Pre-A6.1
artifacts at `ceremony/v5-stub/` are archived (V5 layout, 14 signals);
the V5.1 test consumes `ceremony/v5_1/` exclusively.

### V5.10 — Cross-package isomorphism (#25)

`src/build-witness-v5.ts` and helpers MUST work in a browser bundle
without polyfills. That means:

- **No `node:crypto`** — use `@noble/hashes/sha2#sha256`.
- **No `ethers/lib/utils.keccak256`** — use `@noble/hashes/sha3#keccak_256`.
- **No CJS `require`** — `import { buildPoseidon } from 'circomlibjs'`.

The web-eng vendored copy at `arch-web/sdk/src/witness/v5/` runs a
SHA-256 fingerprint drift-check against this package; any divergence
that requires a polyfill is a drift-check failure, not a "patch
on re-sync" target.

## V5.1 — Wallet-bound nullifier amendment (current)

V5.1 layers on top of V5 architecture per
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-30-wallet-bound-nullifier-amendment.md`
(v0.6, user-approved). All V5 invariants (§V5.1–§V5.10 above) remain
in force; the items below are additive. Spec was originally drafted as
"Issuer-Blind Nullifier" through v0.5 and renamed in v0.6 — older
commits still reference the original name; both refer to the same
amendment.

### V5.11 — Public-signal layout grows from 14 → 19 (FROZEN)

V5.1 inherits the V5 14-signal core (slots 0-13) and appends 5 new
public outputs at slots 14-18:

| Slot | Signal | Source |
|---|---|---|
| 14 | `identityFingerprint` | `Poseidon₂(subjectSerialPacked, FINGERPRINT_DOMAIN)` |
| 15 | `identityCommitment` | `Poseidon₂(subjectSerialPacked, walletSecret)` |
| 16 | `rotationMode` | 0 = register, 1 = rotateWallet |
| 17 | `rotationOldCommitment` | prior `identityCommitment` (rotate) / no-op equal to slot 15 (register) |
| 18 | `rotationNewWallet` | new wallet (rotate) / no-op equal to `msgSender` (register) |

**Slot 2 (`nullifier`) keeps its index but its construction changes**:
V5 derived it from `Poseidon₂(subjectSerial-derived-secret, ctxHashField)`;
V5.1 re-derives it as `Poseidon₂(walletSecret, ctxHashField)`. Slot
position is preserved for forward-compat with V5 calldata indexing,
but the value differs across the version boundary — fixtures from V5
will NOT round-trip against the V5.1 stub vkey.

This layout is **FROZEN** per orchestration §1.1. Reorderings or
insertions are cross-worker breaking changes — the contracts-eng
calldata indices (`uint[19] publicInputs[14..18]`) and web-eng SDK
(`packages/sdk/fixtures/v5_1/verification_key.json`) both pin against
this exact order.

### V5.12 — `walletSecret` private input + mod-p reduction strategy

V5.1 adds **one** new private input: `signal input walletSecret` —
a single BN254 field element (NOT 2 limbs, NOT a 254-bit mask).

**Why mod-p, not mask:** an earlier draft used `walletSecret = (input & ((1<<254)-1))`
to keep values in `[0, 2^254)`. **This was unsound**: BN254's scalar
field `p ≈ 0.756 × 2^254`, so values in `[p, 2^254)` silently wrap
mod p in-circuit, allowing two distinct secrets `x` and `x+p` to
collide on `identityCommitment` and `nullifier` while still passing
`Num2Bits(254)`. **Codex pass 1 [P1] caught this** before T2 shipped.

The correct approach is `walletSecret = u256 mod p_bn254` (canonical
field element). Lives in `src/wallet-secret.ts:reduceTo254()` (function
name preserved for backwards compat despite the semantics rename).
This guarantees no aliasing collisions.

The single-field-element (NOT two limbs) choice trades 2 bits of
entropy for ~600 fewer constraints + simpler witness shape. Acceptable
since the input is 256-bit HKDF/Argon2id output (uniformly random).

**Don't change this back to a mask** — soundness loss is real.

### V5.13 — `rotationMode` gate semantics

`rotationMode` is a 1-bit boolean public input. Both modes are
serviced by the SAME circuit (β-fold per spec §"Architecture decision");
the mode flag gates branch-specific constraints via `ForceEqualIfEnabled`.

**Register mode (`rotationMode = 0`):**
- `rotationOldCommitment === identityCommitment` (no-op echo for downstream calldata uniformity).
- `rotationNewWallet === msgSender` (no-op echo).
- Both gates fire under `ForceEqualIfEnabled(rotationMode = 0 ? 1 : 0)` — i.e., enabled when mode is 0.

**Rotate mode (`rotationMode = 1`):**
- `rotationOldCommitment === Poseidon₂(subjectSerialPacked, oldWalletSecret)` — open gate against the prior wallet's secret. **Load-bearing soundness gate**: without it, anyone with cert + on-chain commitment value could craft a valid rotation proof to ANY new wallet. Codex pass 3 [P2] caught this gap in T1; fixed in T3 (+497 constraints).
- `rotationNewWallet` is unconstrained by the circuit (consumer / contract supplies; the contract enforces `rotationNewWallet == new EOA`).
- Old-wallet *authority* (i.e., proving the user controls the prior wallet's private key) is contract-side via a typed-message sig over (chainId, registry, oldCommit, newWallet) — NOT the circuit's job.

The contract enforces the `rotationOldCommitment` matches the on-chain
stored commitment for the caller's identity fingerprint — the circuit
cannot enforce that (no on-chain state inside R1CS).

### V5.14 — Wallet-uniqueness rule (anti-Sybil invariant)

A user's `identityCommitment` is keyed by `(subjectSerialPacked, walletSecret)`.
Per ETSI EN 319 412-1 semantics-identifier namespacing (carried forward
from the V4 person-nullifier amendment), `subjectSerialPacked` is
stable across cert renewals **inside** the identifier namespace
(e.g., all `PNOUA-…` certs from any QTSP collapse to the same value).

**Implication**: the same human holding both `PNOUA-…` and `PNODE-…`
certs (different Member States) produces TWO distinct commitments
+ TWO distinct fingerprints. This is intentional — eIDAS does NOT
require pan-EU identifier collapse; cross-namespace dedup belongs in
a separate identity-escrow layer ABOVE zkqes.

**Implication**: a single user can derive multiple `walletSecret`s
from the SAME identity (e.g., HKDF from different EOA keys), each
producing a different `identityCommitment` for the same `identityFingerprint`.
Wallet-uniqueness is therefore enforced contract-side by **two
`nullifierOf` write-once gates** (per spec v0.6 §"Wallet uniqueness
[v0.5]"):
- `register()` first-claim path: `require(nullifierOf[msg.sender] == 0)`
  before writing `nullifierOf[msg.sender] = nul`. Prevents a wallet
  that already claimed identity X from claiming identity Y.
- `rotateWallet()`: `require(nullifierOf[newWallet] == 0)`. Prevents
  rotating to a wallet that already holds another identity.

Repeat-claim paths against the SAME fingerprint go through `register()`'s
repeat-claim branch (`identityCommitments[fp] != 0`); cross-wallet
re-association on the same identity goes through `rotateWallet()`. The
circuit alone does not detect the multi-wallet case — these gates are
strictly contract-side. `usedFp` is NOT used; uniqueness lives entirely
on `nullifierOf` + `identityCommitments[fp]` + `identityWallets[fp]`.

### V5.15 — `usedCtx[fp][ctxKey]` is load-bearing for the no-reset stance

Even without an `identityReset()` primitive (V5.1 ships none), the
nullifier semantics are preserved across `rotateWallet()`: the
`identityFingerprint` is wallet-independent (`subjectSerialPacked +
FINGERPRINT_DOMAIN`), so `usedCtx[fp][ctxKey]` flags persist forever
regardless of how many times the wallet rotates.

This is the anti-Sybil load-bearing invariant. Future V6 reset paths
(time-locked veto, social recovery via M-of-N guardians) MUST preserve
`usedCtx[fp][*]` write-once semantics; otherwise a stolen-QES attacker
who triggers reset can re-claim against a previously-used context.
Out of scope for A6.1 — flagged in spec v0.5 §"identityReset() — V5
decision".

### V5.16 — Witness-builder API: `walletSecret` is required

`buildWitnessV5` in `src/build-witness-v5.ts` REQUIRES `walletSecret:
Buffer` (32 bytes) as a top-level input field. The rotate path requires
`rotationMode: 1` PLUS three additional inputs (`rotationOldCommitment`,
`rotationNewWalletAddress`, `oldWalletSecret`) — all three are required
when `rotationMode === 1`; under register mode (default 0) they default
to no-op self-equal values inside the witness builder.

```ts
const witness = await buildWitnessV5({
  bindingBytes,
  leafCertDer, leafSpki, intSpki,
  signedAttrsDer, signedAttrsMdOffset,
  walletSecret,                            // V5.1 required, 32 bytes
  // -- rotate path (all three required when rotationMode === 1) --
  rotationMode: 0,                         // V5.1 optional, default 0 (register)
  rotationOldCommitment,                   // V5.1 required iff rotationMode=1
  rotationNewWalletAddress,                // V5.1 required iff rotationMode=1 (NB: input field is …Address; the public-signal slot 18 name in the circuit is `rotationNewWallet`)
  oldWalletSecret,                         // V5.1 required iff rotationMode=1
});
```

**Caller responsibility**: derive `walletSecret` via HKDF over a
`personal_sign` signature (EOA path) or Argon2id over a passphrase +
domain-separated salt (SCW path). Per spec v0.6 §"SCW path", the SCW
derivation is:

```
salt = SHA-256("qkb-walletsecret-v1" || chainId || smartWalletAddress)
# frozen protocol byte string; see specs/2026-05-03-zkqes-rename-design.md §3
walletSecret = Argon2id(passphrase, salt, m=64MiB, t=3, p=1, L=32)
walletSecret_field = bytesToField(walletSecret) % p_bn254
```

Web-eng owns the production derivation in `@zkqes/sdk`; this package's
`src/wallet-secret.ts` exports `reduceTo254()` + `packFieldToBytes32()`
for circuit-level test fixtures only. **Both paths MUST produce
byte-identical commitments** — cross-package fingerprint drift here
breaks witness exchange.

### V5.17 — Stub ceremony at `ceremony/v5_1/` supersedes `ceremony/v5-stub/`

Task 4 of A6.1 produces V5.1-specific stub artifacts at
`ceremony/v5_1/`:

- `Groth16VerifierV5_1Stub.sol` — 19-public-input Solidity verifier.
- `verification_key.json` — V5.1 vkey (no "-stub" suffix per pump
  contract; web-eng pins to this filename).
- `proof-sample.json` + `public-sample.json` + `witness-input-sample.json` —
  the (witness, public, proof) triple for round-trip integration tests.
- `zkqes-v5_1-stub.zkey` — gitignored (~2.1 GB).

The V5 stub at `ceremony/v5-stub/` is left as an archive (different
circuit, 14 public signals). Downstream consumers (contracts-eng's
register/rotateWallet, web-eng SDK fixtures) consume `ceremony/v5_1/`
exclusively after the Task 4 pump.

Reproduce: `bash ceremony/scripts/stub-v5_1.sh` (~20-30 min wall with
pot23 cached, ~30-50 GB peak RSS).

## V5.2 — Keccak-on-chain amendment (current)

V5.2 layers on top of V5.1 per
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-01-keccak-on-chain-amendment.md`
(v0.5 draft — user-review gate pending). Every V5.1 invariant
(§V5.11–§V5.17 above —
wallet-bound nullifier, mod-p reduction, rotationMode gate semantics,
wallet-uniqueness rule, usedCtx no-reset stance, witness-builder API
shape) remains in force; the V5.2 items below are amendments to layout
+ ceremony + cross-chain claim, NOT to soundness story.

### V5.18 — Public-signal layout grows from 19 → 22 (FROZEN)

V5.2 inherits the V5.1 19-signal layout, **drops `msgSender` from slot
0** (V5.1's slot 0 was `msgSender`), shifts every other slot up by 1,
then **appends 4 new wallet-pk limb signals at slots 18-21**:

| Slot | Signal | Source / V5.1→V5.2 delta |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | `timestamp` | V5.1 was slot 1; shifted up to 0 after `msgSender` removal |
| 1 | `nullifier` | unchanged from V5.1 (Poseidon₂(walletSecret, ctxFieldHash)) |
| 2-12 | (all V5 base + V5.1 SPKI-commit slots) | unchanged values; slot indices match V5.1 minus 1 |
| 13 | `identityFingerprint` | V5.1 slot 14 → V5.2 slot 13 |
| 14 | `identityCommitment` | V5.1 slot 15 → V5.2 slot 14 |
| 15 | `rotationMode` | V5.1 slot 16 → V5.2 slot 15 |
| 16 | `rotationOldCommitment` | V5.1 slot 17 → V5.2 slot 16 |
| 17 | `rotationNewWallet` | V5.1 slot 18 → V5.2 slot 17 (now contract-enforced equality vs `msg.sender` under register mode, was in-circuit in V5.1) |
| **18** | **`bindingPkXHi`** | **V5.2 NEW** — upper 128 bits big-endian of binding-attested wallet pkX |
| **19** | **`bindingPkXLo`** | **V5.2 NEW** — lower 128 bits big-endian of binding-attested wallet pkX |
| **20** | **`bindingPkYHi`** | **V5.2 NEW** — upper 128 bits big-endian of binding-attested wallet pkY |
| **21** | **`bindingPkYLo`** | **V5.2 NEW** — lower 128 bits big-endian of binding-attested wallet pkY |

This layout is **FROZEN** per spec §"Public-signal layout V5.1 → V5.2".
Reorderings or insertions are cross-worker breaking changes — the
contracts-eng calldata indices (`uint[22] publicInputs[18..21]`) and
web-eng SDK (`packages/sdk/fixtures/v5_2/verification_key.json`) both
pin against this exact order. V5.1 fixtures at `ceremony/v5_1/`
(19-signal layout) will NOT round-trip against the V5.2 stub vkey.

### V5.19 — In-circuit keccak gate removed; contract reconstructs

V5 §6.8 had an in-circuit keccak chain that reduced the binding pk to
`msg.sender` and asserted equality. V5.2 removes that chain entirely:

- `Secp256k1PkMatch.circom` and `Secp256k1AddressDerive.circom` are
  no longer included from the main circuit (still in-tree for V5.1
  archive consumers).
- `bkomuves/hash-circuits` keccak primitive (§V5.6) is no longer
  invoked from the V5.2 main circuit.
- The 4 V5.2 limb publics are byte-identical to V5.1's
  `Secp256k1PkMatch` input bytes (`parser.pkBytes[1..65]`), packed at
  128-bit instead of 64-bit granularity. Contract reassembles via
  `pkX = (Hi << 128) | Lo` per coordinate, prepends `0x04` (SEC1
  uncompressed prefix), runs `keccak256(uncompressed_pk)`, casts the
  low-160 bits, asserts `== msg.sender`. ~150 gas overhead vs V5.1's
  in-circuit gate (the contract-side keccak is the cheap leg).

The SEC1 prefix byte `0x04` IS still asserted in-circuit (`parser.pkBytes[0] === 4`)
to lock the wire format. Removing that constraint would let a malicious
prover supply `0x06`/`0x07` (SEC1 compressed encodings) and the contract
keccak would then hash the wrong bytes.

**Cross-chain implication** (informational): V5.2 unblocks deploying the
verifier on chains without a 256-bit-word keccak gas profile (cheap
keccak is EVM-native). Practical scope today is bounded to EVM-family —
the OTHER chain dependency, P-256 ECDSA via EIP-7212 / RIP-7212, is
still required (mainnet, Base, OP have it; Arbitrum + Polygon zkEVM
do NOT). Non-EVM chains need separate auth shims.

### V5.20 — Constraint envelope drops; pot22 supersedes pot23

| | V5.1 | V5.2 |
|---|---|---|
| Constraints | 4,022,171 | **3,876,304** (-145,867) |
| Public inputs | 19 | **22** |
| Private inputs | 10,526 | **10,518** (`pkX[4]` + `pkY[4]` removed; net -8. `msgSender` was a V5.1 PUBLIC signal, not a private input — its removal shifts public-signal count, not private-input count) |
| Wires | ~3,956,793 | ~3,818,735 |
| Powers-of-tau | pot23 | **pot22** (cap 4,194,304 — 8% headroom over 3.876M) |
| ptau download | 9.1 GB | **4.83 GB** (Phase B contributors save 4.6 GB) |

**Pot22 sha256 (first-trust-on-use)**:
`68a21bef870d5d4a9de39c8f35ebcf04e18ef97e14b2cd3f4c3e39876821d362`
measured 2026-05-03 against the Polygon zkEVM mirror at
`https://storage.googleapis.com/zkevm/ptau/powersOfTau28_hez_final_22.ptau`.
Stub-ceremony script `ceremony/scripts/stub-v5_2.sh` pins to this
hash unconditionally on every run. **Phase B real ceremony MUST
cross-validate against an independent Hermez announcement source**
before dispatch (open question #5 in the V5.2 spec).

The `4.5M` constraint cap from §V5.4 still applies; the V5.2 envelope
sits comfortably under both that cap and the pot22 cap. **Don't widen
the cap** — same reasoning as §V5.4 (mobile-browser prove-time + zkey
download).

### V5.21 — Witness-builder API: pk-limb fields are OUTPUT, not input

`buildWitnessV5` no longer accepts `pkX[4]` or `pkY[4]` private-input
fields — those were V5.1's in-circuit Secp256k1PkMatch inputs and have
no analog under V5.2. (V5.1 `BuildWitnessV5Input` never had a `msgSender`
field either — V5.1 derived `msgSender` internally and emitted it as
public-signal output; V5.2 still derives it internally for the
register-mode `rotationNewWallet` no-op default but no longer emits it
to the public-signal vector.) The 4 V5.2 wallet-pk limb fields are
emitted as witness OUTPUT (auto-derived from the SEC1-uncompressed pk
parsed out of `bindingBytes`):

```ts
const witness = await buildWitnessV5({
  bindingBytes,
  leafCertDer, leafSpki, intSpki,
  signedAttrsDer, signedAttrsMdOffset,
  walletSecret,                 // V5.1 required, unchanged
  rotationMode: 0,              // V5.1, unchanged
  // …rotation fields, V5.1, unchanged…
});
// witness.bindingPkXHi / bindingPkXLo / bindingPkYHi / bindingPkYLo
// are computed by the witness builder from parser.pkBytes[1..65],
// packed big-endian at 128-bit halves.  Contract reassembles + keccaks.
```

**Caller responsibility**: NONE for the new fields — the witness
builder owns the derivation. Web-eng SDK consumers do NOT need to
supply pk-limb inputs. The cross-package isomorphism check (§V5.10)
covers the byte-identical packing between Node + browser builds.

The packing is `bytesBeToBigInt(slice)` over 16-byte windows from
`parser.pkBytes[1..17]` / `[17..33]` / `[33..49]` / `[49..65]`. An
asymmetric-pk unit test in `test/integration/build-witness-v5.test.ts`
locks down the windowing — symmetric synthetic fixtures (X = 0x11×32,
Y = 0x22×32) would let a Hi/Lo swap or off-by-16 bug pass silently.

### V5.22 — Stub ceremony at `ceremony/v5_2/` supersedes `ceremony/v5_1/`

T3 of A7.1 produces V5.2-specific stub artifacts at `ceremony/v5_2/`:

- `Groth16VerifierV5_2Stub.sol` — 22-public-input Solidity verifier.
- `verification_key.json` — V5.2 vkey (no "-stub" suffix per pump
  contract; web-eng pins to this filename).
- `proof-sample.json` + `public-sample.json` + `witness-input-sample.json`
  — the (witness, public, proof) triple for round-trip integration tests.
- `zkqes-v5_2-stub.zkey` — gitignored (~2.0 GB; pump via R2).
- `zkey.sha256` — atomic-write integrity manifest. Manifest invariant:
  `zkey.sha256 exists ⇔ ceremony script reached the last line`.

The V5.1 stub at `ceremony/v5_1/` is left as an archive (different
circuit, 19 public signals, in-circuit keccak chain). Downstream
consumers (contracts-eng's V5.2 register/rotateWallet, web-eng SDK
fixtures) consume `ceremony/v5_2/` exclusively after the T3 pump.
The V5 stub at `ceremony/v5-stub/` (14 public signals, pre-A6.1)
remains the older archive.

Reproduce: `pnpm -F @zkqes/circuits ceremony:v5_2:stub` (~25 min wall
with pot22 cached + R1CS+wasm cached, ~30-50 GB peak RSS; ~60-120 min
cold including pot22 fetch over EU broadband). The script is
idempotent — re-runs short-circuit through cached artifacts and
re-emit a bytewise-stable manifest. Cascade pre-wipe pattern: any
upstream regen wipes `zkey.sha256` BEFORE the risky operation runs,
so a mid-run failure cannot leave a stale manifest validating against
an incoherent bundle.

**Per-step cookbook detail** (calibrated to 2026-05-03 T3 run):
- `snarkjs zkey contribute` runs **~5-7 min** on V5.2's ~2 GB zkey,
  not "~30s" as V5.1's README implied — snarkjs 0.7.6 emits DEBUG-level
  per-65,536-wire progress that V5.1's contribute log didn't surface.
  Phase B contributors who watch their machine sit at "L Section
  327680/3818712" for several minutes will assume something is broken
  unless they read this section first. The work is real; the wall
  scales with L+M+H section size.

## V5.3 — OID-anchor + rotationNewWallet range-check amendment (current)

The V5.3 amendment adds three changes to `ZkqesPresentationV5.circom`
in-place: F1 OID-anchor (closes the V5.2 Sybil vector via
"any 32-byte window in signed TBS"), F2 rotationNewWallet 160-bit
range-check (defense-in-depth; circuit + contract on rotateWallet),
F3 walletSecret↔msgSender contract-side doc note. **Public-signal
layout UNCHANGED** — V5.3 keeps V5.2's frozen 22-signal shape;
contracts-eng's `verifyProof(uint[22])` calldata + web-eng's SDK fixture
shape carry across unchanged.

Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-03-v5_3-oid-anchor-amendment.md`
(v0.2; v0.1 → v0.2 amendments folded same-day from T1+T2 measurements).
Orchestration: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-03-v5_3-orchestration.md`.

### V5.31 — Subject-serial OID-anchor (F1)

The V5.2 §6.9 leafTbs↔leafCert byte-consistency gate proves the 32-byte
serial-number window is present in the signed TBS, but the offset is a
free witness — a malicious prover could pick ANY 32-byte window in the
TBS that survives the §6.6 X509SubjectSerial range-check. Combined with
rotateWallet (which clears the old `identityCommitment` slot), this
becomes a multi-mint Sybil vector (one QES → N identities by selecting
different sub-windows).

V5.31 closes this by adding a NEW private witness input
`subjectSerialOidOffsetInTbs` and 7 multiplexer reads (5 OID bytes +
1 string-tag + 1 length) at that offset:

```circom
// OID 2.5.4.5 (id-at-serialNumber): 06 03 55 04 05
// String tag: 0x13 PrintableString OR 0x0c UTF8String (XOR check)
// Length byte == subjectSerialValueLength
// subjectSerialValueOffsetInTbs === subjectSerialOidOffsetInTbs + 7
```

Cost: **+19,892 R1CS constraints** (V5.2 baseline 3,876,304 →
3,896,196 after F1 alone). The cost dominates V5.3's footprint;
circomlib `Multiplexer(1, 1408)` is **~2,800 constraints/mux**, not
~1,408 linear (uses MultiMux{n} binary-tree decomposition + per-bit
Num2Bits selector). Spec v0.1 projected ~10K from a per-mux ≈ MAX
linear scan; v0.2 corrected to ~2,800/mux.

The accepted string-tag scope is intentionally `0x13`/`0x0c` only.
X.520's `0x14` (TeletexString), `0x16` (IA5String), `0x1e` (BMPString)
are rejected because §6.6's byte-pack assumes 1-byte-per-character
PrintableString-or-UTF8String semantics — accepting BMPString (UTF-16BE)
would silently produce wrong identityFingerprint values. ETSI EN 319
412-1 §5.1.3 namespace strings (`TINUA-…`, `PNODE-…`, `IDC??-`, etc.)
are all PrintableString-compatible, so widening to the X.520 superset
adds attack surface without serving a real namespace.

Witness builder: the new private input is **derived trivially** —
`subjectSerialOidOffsetInTbs = subjectSerialValueOffsetInTbs - 7` (the
7-byte ASN.1 frame is fixed-shape per X.690 + X.520 length is single-
byte definite-form because the ETSI namespace strings are ≤ 127 bytes).
No X.509 walker change in `src/build-witness-v5.ts`; just a single-line
addition + emission.

### V5.32 — rotationNewWallet 160-bit range-check (F2)

V5.32 adds an in-circuit `Num2Bits(160)` over `rotationNewWallet`,
bounding it to a true Ethereum-address-shaped value before the proof
ships to the contract. Eliminates the "trust the contract to bound it"
assumption.

**Critical optimizer footgun**: a bare `Num2Bits(160)` whose bit-outputs
are unused is dead-code-eliminated by **circom 2.1.9 -O1** when the
input has no other downstream consumer in the circuit. Empirically
measured during T2: bare pattern adds **0 R1CS constraints**. The V5.2
walletSecret/oldWalletSecret Num2Bits(254) checks DO fire (verified
empirically via task #63 — V5.2 minus those two checks shows exactly
−508 = 254+254 constraint delta) because walletSecret feeds Poseidon₂
for nullifier + identityCommitment; the input is consumed downstream,
forcing the bit-decomposition alive.

For `rotationNewWallet` (orphaned post-V5.2 keccak-on-chain when the
in-circuit equality gate dropped), the bare pattern fails. Fix is the
**parent-level boolean re-assertion + weighted-sum equality** pattern:

```circom
component rotationNewWalletBits = Num2Bits(160);
rotationNewWalletBits.in <== rotationNewWallet;
var rotationBitWeightedSum = 0;
for (var rnb = 0; rnb < 160; rnb++) {
    rotationNewWalletBits.out[rnb] * (rotationNewWalletBits.out[rnb] - 1) === 0;
    rotationBitWeightedSum += rotationNewWalletBits.out[rnb] * (1 << rnb);
}
rotationBitWeightedSum === rotationNewWallet;
```

Booleanity re-assertion + weighted-sum equality together force both
legs of the optimizer rule to engage. Cost: **+161 R1CS constraints**
(160 booleanity + 1 sum-eq). This is the canonical optimizer-aliveness
pattern for any future amendment that needs an in-circuit range-check
on an otherwise-orphaned input — DO NOT use bare `Num2Bits(N)` or
`LessThan(N+1)` (both empirically observed to be optimized away).

#### Post-mortem — V5.1 → V5.2 cascading aliveness loss

The optimizer-pruning vulnerability for `rotationNewWallet` is a
**cascading effect from the V5.2 amendment**, not a V5.3-introduced
regression. Timeline:

- **V5.1**: `rotationNewWallet` was kept alive (under -O1) by the
  in-circuit equality gate `rotationNewWallet === msgSender`
  (V5.1's wallet-uniqueness anchor). That gate's existence
  forced `rotationNewWallet`'s value to be consumed by another
  constraint, which in turn forced any range-check chain on it
  to stay live. A bare `Num2Bits(160)` would have fired in V5.1.
- **V5.2 keccak-on-chain amendment**: dropped the in-circuit
  `=== msgSender` equality (keccak gate moved to the contract,
  msgSender removed from public signals). That dropped the
  ONLY consumer of `rotationNewWallet` inside the circuit.
- **Latent effect**: any future bare `Num2Bits(160)` over
  `rotationNewWallet` would silently be optimized away, because
  the input is now orphaned. V5.3's defense-in-depth range-check
  was the first amendment to attempt one, exposing the issue.

**Generalized rule (canonical for any future bit-range work):**

> When a public-signal slot is no longer constrained by any
> in-circuit gate (e.g., V5.2's `rotationNewWallet` after dropping
> the in-circuit equality with `msgSender`), bare `Num2Bits()`
> range checks may be optimized away by circom -O1. Use parent-
> aliveness pattern (boolean re-assert outputs at parent scope +
> weighted-sum equality reconstruction) for orphaned signals.

The previous-amendment lesson: **constraint deletions can void
range-check assumptions in unrelated amendments** added later.
When dropping an in-circuit constraint, audit downstream amendments
that may have implicitly relied on it for aliveness.

#### Why V5.2's `walletSecret` / `oldWalletSecret` Num2Bits(254) ARE sound

Empirical verification (task #63, 2026-05-03): V5.2 baseline 3,876,304
constraints minus `walletSecret` and `oldWalletSecret` Num2Bits(254)
checks = 3,875,796. Delta: **−508 = 254 + 254** — both bare Num2Bits
chains DID land in the r1cs.

Why these are different from `rotationNewWallet`'s case: `walletSecret`
flows into Poseidon₂ for nullifier (`Poseidon₂(walletSecret, ctxHash)`)
+ identityCommitment (`Poseidon₂(subjectPack, walletSecret)`) — the
input is **consumed downstream**, which forces the bit-decomposition
chain alive even without parent-aliveness. `oldWalletSecret`
similarly flows into identityCommitment-of-old-fp via Poseidon₂
under the rotate-mode gate. Both have a downstream consumer that
keeps their range-check chain alive.

**T2.5 fold-in NOT needed for V5.2 walletSecret/oldWalletSecret.**
The bare `Num2Bits(254)` checks are sound at V5.2 because of the
Poseidon-downstream consumption. V5.3 amendment scope stays at T1
(F1 OID-anchor) + T2 (witness builder + tests) + T3 (ceremony stub)
+ docs. Pot22 headroom remains 7.10%.

**Workers should question "skip verification, just fix" calls when
verification is cheap** (process learning logged 2026-05-03 by lead).
The empirical compile (~10 min) was cheaper than the cost of a
defensive fix that would have added 508 redundant constraints,
muddied the auditor narrative, and committed the team to a non-
needed amendment.

Contract side (V5.3 §F2.2): the contract-side range check belongs on
**`rotateWallet()` only** (per contracts-eng commit `1b260d8`). In
`register()` the contract derives `rotationNewWallet` from keccak
internally → naturally 160-bit by construction, so a check would be
dead code. In `rotateWallet()` the holder supplies the value as a free
witness (the new EOA address); a buggy SDK or malicious client could
pass high-bit-set garbage, the contract-side check catches it.

### V5.33 — walletSecret ↔ msgSender doc (F3)

V5.33 is **documentation-only** — a comment block at the walletSecret
private input declaration in `ZkqesPresentationV5.circom` referencing the
V5.1 wallet-bound nullifier amendment §"Wallet-uniqueness gate
location" and stating that the wallet-uniqueness invariant is
enforced contract-side at `identityWallets[fp]`, not circuit-side.

Reason for the explicit doc: a future contributor seeing
"msgSender isn't a private input in the circuit, must be wrong, let's
add it" would either be ineffective (V5.2 dropped msgSender as a public
signal) or break the rotation flow's storage semantics (the circuit
can't see on-chain state; the wallet-uniqueness gate requires reading
ALL prior identities for the same fp, which requires storage reads).

No constraint cost.

### V5.34 — Constraint envelope (V5.3 measured)

| Source | V5.2 measured | V5.3 measured |
|---|---|---|
| Base | 3,876,304 | 3,876,304 |
| F1 OID-anchor | — | +19,892 |
| F2 rotationNewWallet aliveness | — | +161 |
| F3 doc | — | 0 |
| **Total** | 3,876,304 | **3,896,356** |
| pot22 cap | 4,194,304 | 4,194,304 |
| Headroom | 7.6% | **7.10%** |

Pot22 reused; no jump to pot23. V5.3 ceremony is a fresh single-
contributor stub (pre-Phase B) at `ceremony/v5_3/` produced by
`ceremony/scripts/stub-v5_3.sh` (mirrors V5.2's stub script with
`v5_2/` → `v5_3/` path renames + `Groth16VerifierV5_3Stub` contract
name). Reproduce: `pnpm -F @zkqes/circuits ceremony:v5_3:stub`. The V5.2
stub at `ceremony/v5_2/` becomes the V5.2 archive, matching the V5.1 →
V5.2 supersession pattern.

If a future amendment grows constraints another ~120K (lands above
4.05M ≈ 96.6% of pot22 cap), spec amendment + ceremony pot22 → pot23
step-up is required.

### V5.35 — QES cert lifecycle vs wallet rotation (orthogonal flows)

QES (Qualified Electronic Signature) certificates have a finite
validity period (ETSI / eIDAS qualified certs typically ~2-3 years
NotBefore → NotAfter).  Cert reissuance and wallet rotation are two
**orthogonal** flows in the V5 protocol; conflating them is a common
source of misunderstanding for new contributors.

**The two flows:**

1. **Wallet rotation** (V5's `rotateWallet` flow, V5.1 amendment) —
   for a compromised wallet, lost device, or voluntary key rotation.
   The natural-person identity (`identityFingerprint`) STAYS THE
   SAME; only the `identityCommitment` changes (new `walletSecret`
   ↔ new wallet binding).  Proves possession of the OLD `walletSecret`
   + binds the NEW wallet via the same QES proof pathway.  Requires
   a valid QES at proof time (cert chain still verifies).

2. **QES cert reissuance** (cert end-of-life or QTSP-driven rotation)
   — when a holder's QES cert hits NotAfter and they get a fresh
   cert from their QTSP.  **No on-chain action required.**  The
   existing registration (identityFingerprint + identityCommitment +
   wallet binding) persists indefinitely; cert expiry does NOT
   invalidate prior storage.

**Why cert reissuance is invisible to the protocol:**

V5.1's `subjectPack = Poseidon(subjectSerialLimbs, len)` hashes over
the bytes of the **subject.serialNumber RDN** value, V5.3's F1
OID-anchor pinning that to OID 2.5.4.5.  Per ETSI EN 319 412-1
§5.1.3, this is the **natural-person semantics identifier** —
prefixed with `TINUA-…` (Ukrainian taxpayer number), `PNOUA-…`
(Ukrainian national ID), `IDC??-…` (ID card), `PAS??-…` (passport),
`CPI…` (commercial), etc.  These prefixes encode **durable
government-issued identifiers** that are stable across cert
reissues.  A holder's TIN doesn't change when their cert expires;
the new cert from the QTSP carries the same `TINUA-…` value.

So `subjectPack` → `identityFingerprint` is **stable across cert
reissues**.  Any future `register()` against the new cert collides
with the existing fingerprint slot (the `identityWallets[fp]`
storage gate from V5.14 fires — that's the wallet-uniqueness
invariant doing its job).  Any future `rotateWallet()` proof
generated against the new cert produces the SAME `identityFingerprint`
and the rotate gate matches up against the on-chain slot.

**What DOES NOT survive cert reissuance** (and is fine, per design):

- `leafSpkiCommit` / `intSpkiCommit` — different per cert (new SPKI
  bytes).  These are per-proof public signals, not stored long-term.
- Cert NotBefore / NotAfter — V5 does NOT enforce cert
  validity-window in-circuit.  The cert chain (leaf → intermediate)
  is verified via SPKI commits + P256Verify, but the validity
  window is an **SDK-layer concern**, not a circuit-layer one.
- The QTSP's signature, the cert's full DER bytes, etc. — all
  per-proof artifacts.

**What DOES survive (the durable identity anchor):**

- `identityFingerprint` (stored per-fp at registration)
- `identityCommitment` (stored per-fp; updated by rotateWallet)
- The wallet binding (`identityWallets[fp]`)

**Edge cases worth flagging:**

- **QTSP rotates their intermediate cert**: leaf chain changes;
  new `leafSpkiCommit` / `intSpkiCommit` per proof, but those are
  per-proof not stored — fine.
- **Natural-person serial actually changes** (rare — e.g., the
  person changes citizenship and gets a new TIN, or a passport-
  prefixed identity migrates to a national-ID-prefixed identity):
  produces a different `subjectPack` → different `identityFingerprint`.
  Not "rotation" in V5's sense — that's a NEW identity at a fresh
  fp slot.  V5 takes the stance that ETSI namespace identifiers
  are canonically distinct (current spec position; reconsider only
  if a real identity-continuity use-case surfaces).
- **Holder whose cert just expired AND wants to rotate wallet**:
  must acquire a new valid cert from their QTSP first, THEN run
  `rotateWallet()` against the new cert.  The rotateWallet proof
  requires a chain-verifying QES at proof time.
- **Holder whose cert expired but doesn't need to do anything**:
  no action.  Their existing registration is fine indefinitely.
  The protocol has no "renew" or "refresh" concept; once registered,
  the wallet→identity binding is permanent absent rotation.

**SDK-layer responsibility** (where this lands UX-side, packages/sdk
+ packages/web): detect cert expiry, prompt the holder to acquire
a new cert from their QTSP, then proceed with the proof flow.  No
new SDK API surface needed for "cert rotation" — the existing
register / rotateWallet flows handle the new cert transparently
because subject.serialNumber is stable.

**Why this is documented HERE (circuits CLAUDE.md) and not just
in the SDK doc:** the orthogonality only makes sense if you
understand WHY `identityFingerprint` is invariant across cert
reissues, which requires knowing that V5.1's `subjectPack` hashes
the natural-person serial-number (V5.3 OID-anchored) and NOT the
cert serial-number / SPKI / signature.  That's a circuit-layer
fact.  The SDK CLAUDE.md should reference this V5.35 entry rather
than restate it.


## V5.5 — Multi-algorithm signature extension amendment (current)

V5.5 layers on V5.4 per spec
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-07-v5_5-multi-algorithm-signature-extension.md`.
Every V5.x invariant above (§V5.1–§V5.35) remains in force; the V5.5
items below are amendments to the **trust-list commitment scheme**
(P-256-only → algorithm-agnostic) and the **circuit envelope** (pot22
→ pot23). The soundness story (wallet-bound nullifier, rotation-mode
gates, ETSI namespace identifier semantics) is unchanged.

### V5.51 — Algorithm-agnostic KeyCommit replaces P-256 SpkiCommit

V5.4's `leafSpkiCommit = Poseidon₂(Poseidon₆(Xlimbs), Poseidon₆(Ylimbs))`
hardcoded ECDSA-P256 affine-coord packing. V5.5 replaces it with a
**byte-level Poseidon-domain commitment** over the canonical SPKI DER:

```
keyCommit(spki) = Poseidon₂( KEY_COMMIT_DOMAIN,
                             PoseidonChunkHashVarT7(spkiDerBytes) )
```

Where `KEY_COMMIT_DOMAIN = bigint(keccak256("zkqes-key-commit-v1")) mod p_bn254`,
yielding the frozen field constant
`18645781269818968495274020647839177040876380151358417993861915365514852958754`.
The string `"zkqes-key-commit-v1"` is a frozen ProtocolBytes literal
(see CLAUDE.md ProtocolBytes invariant); never renamed in any future
amendment.

**Why algorithm-blind**: removes the per-algorithm circuit specialization
that V5.4 baked in (P-256 limb-decomposition + Poseidon₆ over the limbs).
V5.5 commits the SPKI bytes verbatim, making the trust-list construction
itself algorithm-neutral. Adding RSA-2048/3072/4096 (or any future
algorithm whose canonical SPKI fits ≤ MAX_LEAF_SPKI=600 bytes) requires
zero circuit changes — just a new host-side verifier dispatch in
`HostSig.sol`.

### V5.52 — Three-language byte-parity tripod

KeyCommit's value MUST be byte-identical across THREE implementations:
- **Circom**: `circuits/primitives/KeyCommitVar.circom` (witness/circuit gate)
- **Solidity**: `packages/contracts/src/libs/KeyCommit.sol` (on-chain Gate 5
  trust-list verification + caller-supplied `leafKeyCommit` check)
- **TS**: `packages/sdk/src/witness/v5_5/key-commit.ts` (witness builder
  + flattener trust-list root construction)

A fourth byte-identical implementation lives in
`packages/lotl-flattener/src/ca/keyCommit.ts` (mirrors the SDK file
verbatim with hardcoded domain constant; depends only on `circomlibjs`,
no `@noble/hashes` pull-in). The flattener's parity test asserts
equivalence against the shared
`fixtures/v5_5/key-commit-parity.json` fixture (10 vectors covering
empty SPKI, sponge boundaries, P-256 SPKI, RSA-2048/3072/4096 SPKIs).

Drift between any two implementations breaks the V5.5 trust-list /
proof equality invariant (spec §12 invariants 5+6) — Gate 5 trust-list
membership check fails silently. The shared parity fixture is the
single source of truth; regenerate via
`pnpm --filter @zkqes/sdk exec tsx scripts/gen-key-commit-parity.ts`
and pump to the flattener via the standard cross-worktree fixture
copy pattern.

### V5.53 — PoseidonChunkHashVarT7 (NEW primitive, T7 not T16)

V5.4's `PoseidonChunkHashVar` uses RATE=15 (Poseidon-T16 per round).
**V5.5 introduces a parallel primitive at T7** (RATE=5, Poseidon-6
per round) — additive, not breaking; V5.4's T16 chunk-hash stays
in tree for V5.x archive consumers and current
`canonicalizeCertHash` / nullifier-derivation paths.

**Why T7 over T16**: Solidity has `Poseidon.hashT7` deployed via
`PoseidonBytecode` (the existing PoseidonT7 contract — `hashT7` is
arity 6→1) but does NOT have `hashT16`. Using T16 in V5.5 would
require deploying a new opaque bytecode contract + extending the
reproducibility-check gate. Picking T7 keeps on-chain `KeyCommit.sol`
as a `hashT7`-in-loop and reuses existing infrastructure.

Sponge sizing for V5.5:
- RATE = 5 (5 field elements absorbed per round)
- CHUNK = 31 bytes per field element (matches V5.4)
- MAX_LEAF_SPKI = 600 bytes (covers RSA-4096 SPKI ~550 bytes)
- N_FE_MAX = ⌈600/31⌉ + 1 = 21 (chunks ‖ length)
- N_ROUNDS_MAX = ⌈21/5⌉ = 5

In practice: P-256 SPKI (91B) → 1 round; RSA-2048 (~294B) → 3 rounds;
RSA-4096 (~550B) → 4 rounds. MAX_ROUNDS=5 leaves headroom for SPKIs
up to 620 bytes.

### V5.54 — 21-signal public layout (down from V5.4's 22)

V5.5 drops `intSpkiCommit` (V5.4's slot 12) and renames `leafSpkiCommit`
(V5.4 slot 11) → `leafKeyCommit`. All V5.4 slots [13..21] shift down
by 1:

| V5.5 slot | Signal | V5.4 source |
|---|---|---|
| [11] | `leafKeyCommit` | replaces `leafSpkiCommit`, new construction (V5.51) |
| [12] | `identityFingerprint` | V5.4 [13] |
| [13] | `identityCommitment` | V5.4 [14] |
| [14] | `rotationMode` | V5.4 [15] |
| [15] | `rotationOldCommitment` | V5.4 [16] |
| [16] | `rotationNewWallet` | V5.4 [17] |
| [17..20] | `bindingPkXHi/Lo` + `bindingPkYHi/Lo` | V5.4 [18..21] |

Slots [0..10] unchanged from V5.4. Layout is **FROZEN per spec §6**;
the `verifyProof(uint[21])` ABI is the cross-worker breaking-change
boundary. V5.4 fixtures (22-signal layout) will NOT round-trip against
V5.5 stub vkey or vice versa.

The intermediate-key commitment is no longer emitted from the proof.
The contract computes `KeyCommit.commitSpki(intSpki)` at register time
(Gate 5 trust-list Merkle membership), dropping the V5.4 requirement
that the prover witness intermediate-SPKI parsing.

### V5.55 — Per-byte Multiplexer cost + pot23 envelope (FROZEN)

The V5.5 byte-equality gate (proves `leafSpkiBytes[0..len]` matches
the corresponding `leafTbsBytes` slice at `leafSpkiOffsetInTbs`) uses
`Multiplexer(1, MAX_LEAF_TBS=1408)` per byte. Empirical cost:
**~2,800 constraints/mux × 600 SPKI bytes ≈ 1.68M constraints** for
the slice-and-equate, dominating the V5.5 envelope.

| | V5.3 measured | V5.5 measured |
|---|---|---|
| Constraints | 3,896,356 | **5,604,985** (+1,708,629) |
| Public inputs | 22 | **21** (-1, intSpkiCommit dropped) |
| Powers-of-tau | pot22 (cap 4.19M) | **pot23 (cap 8.39M)** |
| ptau download | 4.83 GB | **9.1 GB** |
| Phase 2 setup wall | ~10-15 min | **~25-35 min** |
| Phase 2 setup peak RSS | ~30 GB | **~40 GB** |

**Pot23 is locked** per spec §13.4 (founder accepted 2026-05-08).
~33% headroom over the 5.6M envelope — sufficient room for V5.5
follow-ups (V5.6 lost-wallet recovery is design-stage, expected
≤200K extra constraints if it lands as a parallel branch in the
same circuit).

Cap policy: same as V5.4 (`4,500,000` was the V5.3 cap; V5.5
implicitly raises this to `~6,000,000` for amendment fit). Mobile-
browser prove-time + zkey-download envelope shifts upward
proportionally — ~120s prove + ~3 GB zkey is the new V5.5 floor.

### V5.56 — Witness builder layers on V5.4 (no full rewrite)

`packages/sdk/src/witness/v5_5/build-witness-v5_5.ts` delegates to
`buildWitnessV5_2` (V5.4 builder) for shared computation, then
reshapes:

1. Drops 4 V5.4 P-256 limb arrays: `leafXLimbs[6]`, `leafYLimbs[6]`,
   `intXLimbs[6]`, `intYLimbs[6]`.
2. Drops 2 V5.4 public signals: `leafSpkiCommit`, `intSpkiCommit`.
3. Walks `leafTbsBytes` to locate the leaf SPKI sub-DER via
   `findLeafSpkiInTbs(tbs)` (added to `leaf-cert-walk.ts`).
4. Computes `leafKeyCommit = keyCommit(spkiDer)` via the shared TS
   reference.
5. Adds 3 new private inputs: `leafSpkiBytes` (padded to MAX_LEAF_SPKI),
   `leafSpkiLength`, `leafSpkiOffsetInTbs`.

V5.4 inherited inputs (binding bytes, signed-attrs, leafTbsBytes,
identity-extraction offsets, V5.3 OID anchor) flow through unchanged
via spread. Caller responsibility unchanged from V5.4 — same input
shape (`BuildWitnessV5_2Input`); divergence is on the output side.

### V5.57 — Stub ceremony at `ceremony/v5_5/` supersedes `ceremony/v5_3/`

Reproduce: `pnpm -F @zkqes/circuits ceremony:v5_5:stub` (~60-120 min
cold including pot23 fetch over EU broadband; ~40-50 min warm).

Same single-contributor caveat as V5.3 stub: sound IF the contributor
is honest AND the pot23 ptau was honestly generated. Real Phase B
ceremony (20-30 contributors per spec §13.4) is a separate dispatch.
Pot23 sha256 pin (first-trust-on-use):
`047f16d75daaccd6fb3f859acc8cc26ad1fb41ef030da070431e95edb126d19d`.

V5.3 stub at `ceremony/v5_3/` (22 public signals, P-256-only
spkiCommit) is left as an archive. V5.5 stub at `ceremony/v5_5/`
(21 public signals, algorithm-agnostic keyCommit) is the canonical
downstream consumer for V5.5 contracts-eng + web-eng integration.

### V5.58 — Signal-input contract lock

`test/v5_5-signal-contract.test.ts` parses
`ZkqesPresentationV5_5.circom` for `signal input` declarations and
asserts the set matches the canonical V5.5 contract (21 public + 43
private signals enumerated in spec §6 + §7.2). Pairs with the
web-side `build-witness-v5_5.test.ts` shape assertion: if both pass,
builder JSON keys are byte-equal to circuit signal declarations,
making "Signal X not found" / "Too many values" failures at
witness-calc time impossible without a CI-visible regression first.

Run: `mocha --grep "V5.5 signal-input contract"` (full mocha suite
OOMs unrelated; use `--grep` to filter).

This is a **static-analysis test** — it does NOT run circom_tester
on the 5.6M-constraint main circuit. A semantic round-trip
(buildWitness output passes calculateWitness) requires the full
~10-min compile and is best run as part of Phase B ceremony dry-run
rather than per-CI.

### V5.59 — Pre-deployed Poseidon pattern back-ported to ZkqesRegistryV5_5

V5.5 contract refactor: `ZkqesRegistryV5_5` constructor now accepts
pre-deployed `poseidonT3` + `poseidonT7` addresses (V5.4 pattern,
post-2026-05-05 Base Sepolia MAX_INITCODE_SIZE failure). Embedding
the ~33 KB Poseidon initcodes inside the registry constructor pushes
total registry initcode over EIP-3860's ~24.5 KB cap on Base Sepolia.
Pre-deploy + pass keeps registry initcode compact.

`script/DeployV5_5.s.sol` does the pre-deploy + wiring; defaults to
`Groth16VerifierV5_5Stub(accepts=true)` so Anvil dry-runs +
pre-ceremony Sepolia smoke land without a real zkey. Real verifier
swaps in via `IDENTITY_VERIFIER_ADDR` env override (drop-in
compatible — same `verifyProof(uint[21])` ABI).
